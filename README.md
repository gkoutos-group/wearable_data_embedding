# Wearable Data Embedding
An unsupervised learning framework for embedding multi-channel timeseries data.
The approach is demonstrated in main.py through comments and modular imports.
Demonstration is on synthetic data, but will work similarly on other multi-channel time series.

Depends on numpy, tensorflow (2.0+) and matplotlib.
